# Scala Basic Training

Resources related to a series of talks I gave on scala around 2021.

This was in the context of training junior developers at LeadIQ who were essentially completely new to scala and FP.

# The talks

Each talk went for about an hour and was run in a zoom call.

The talks are "company property" so the recordings aren't listed here. That might change later if there's nothing sensitive in them.

# Structure

Each talk has a folder in this directory, numbered by the order the talks were done.

The resources are generally slides and code samples.

The slides are designed to be used with a cli presentation tool `lookatme`.

Demos were usually done using simple ammonite scripts or just using the repl. We used ammonite for scala 2.12 but they should generally work with 2.13 onwards. Scripts were run with `amm [SCRIPT.sc]`.

# Methodology

Most of the content focuses on just the syntactic aspects of scala and the standard library, rather than going too deeply into FP.

The training was designed for a specific code base that deliberately doesn't use advanced concepts like FP and concurrency to make it more accessible to juniors and analysts.
